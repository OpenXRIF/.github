Robots are limited in their ability to interpret natural language and execute tasks in ambiguous environments. We're a small team of engineers and researchers building XRIF (eXtensible Robot Instruction Format) to serve as a framework for social robotic intelligence! Our north star is to democratize a robot-agnostic platform, enabling users to define action spaces, constraints, and guardrails for their human-robot interaction use cases.

Here are some cool papers that inspired us:
