We're a small team of engineers and researchers building XRIF (eXtensible Robot Instruction Formatting)!
Our north star is to build a firmware-agnostic platform enabling users to define action spaces, constraints, and guardrails for their human-robot interaction use cases.

Here are some cool papers that inspired us:
